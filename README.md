# Bikini Bottom Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was completed as a part of the Turing Front End Development program. The goal of this project was to create a user friendly, fully functional tic-tac-toe game, with various aspects of functionality: 

1. Players alternate turns. The current player's turn is diplayed in a banner at the top of the screen. Each game will start with a different player than the previous game. 
2. When a player selects a box on the grid, no other player can select that box. If they attempt to, an error message will pop up. 
3. When a player wins, a chain of events occur. The grid becomes unclickable, the banner declares the winner, the player's wins increase by 1, and a new game loads automatically. The player's wins are displayed in their column. 
4. If the result of the game is a draw, the grid will become unclickable, the banner will declare a draw, and the game will automatically reload in about three seconds. 
5. Wins will  be tracked until the page is refreshed. 

## What Does it Look Like?

- This spongebob themed game uses icon displays on the inner grid to track wins and player moves. Each player has their own column, which tracks their wins. The banner communicates significant events in the game.
