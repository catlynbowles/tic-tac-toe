# Bikini Bottom Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was completed as a part of the Turing Front End Development program. The goal of this project was to create a user friendly, fully functional tic-tac-toe game, with various aspects of functionality: 

1. Players alternate turns. The current player's turn is diplayed in a banner at the top of the screen. Each game will start with a different player than the previous game. 
2. When a player selects a box on the grid, no other player can select that box. If they attempt to, an error message will pop up. 
3. When a player wins, a chain of events occur. The grid becomes unclickable, the banner declares the winner, the player's wins increase by 1, and a new game loads automatically. The player's wins are displayed in their column. 
4. If the result of the game is a draw, the grid will become unclickable, the banner will declare a draw, and the game will automatically reload in about three seconds. 
5. Wins will  be tracked until the page is refreshed.
